# Parkinson Prediction Model using Machine Learning 
A simple Parkinson prediction End-to-End model with Support Vector Machine Classifier

## Challenge

Modelling and Structuring the Data from raw format. The data is not available in csv or json format. Its a Raw and Unstructred data.

## Concepts Learnt:

1. Writing complex python functions to model unstructred data from .txt files.
2. Use of various classification models and comparing their accuracy to find the best one.
3. Theory as well as practical implmentation of Classification Models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest.
4. Built an interactive Web app to predict Parkinson by taking input from user using Streamlit Library in Python.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis on unstructred data.

## Web App
